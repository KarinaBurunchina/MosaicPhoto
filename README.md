# MosaicPhoto
 Mosaic photo. The mosaic photo is a method to make an original image consist of small images. These small parts are combined to make an image similar to the original one. I have written the code to produce a mosaic photo out of my own Dataset. The range of colors is crucial in choosing a proper Dataset. As a result, I have created a Dataset from the screenshots of ‘Zootopia’ movie which is pretty colorful.
